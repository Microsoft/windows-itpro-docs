# Group Policy and Mobile Device Management (MDM) settings for Microsoft Edge

> Applies to: Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile

Set up a policy setting once and then copy that setting onto many computers.



Microsoft Edge works with Group Policy and Microsoft Intune to help you manage your organization's computer settings. Group Policy objects (GPOs) can include registry-based Administrative Template policy settings, security settings, software deployment information, scripts, folder redirection, and preferences.

By using Group Policy and Intune, you can set up a policy setting once, and then copy that setting onto many computers. For example, you can set up multiple security settings in a GPO that is linked to a domain, and then apply all of those settings to every computer in the domain.

> [!NOTE]
> For more info about the tools you can use to change your Group Policy objects, see the Internet Explorer 11 topics, [Group Policy and the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617921), [Group Policy and the Local Group Policy Editor](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617922), [Group Policy and the Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617923), and [Group Policy and Windows PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617924).
