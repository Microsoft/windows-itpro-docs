# Interoperability and enterprise guidance
>*Supported versions: Microsoft Edge on Windows 10*  


Microsoft Edge lets you continue to use IE11 for sites that are on your corporate intranet or included on your Enterprise Mode Site List. If you are running web apps that continue to use ActiveX controls, x-ua-compatible headers, or legacy document modes, you need to keep running them in IE11.  IE11 offers additional security, manageability, performance, backward compatibility, and modern standards support.


>[!TIP]
> If you are running an earlier version of Internet Explorer, then we recommend upgrading to IE11, so any legacy apps continue to work correctly.

**Technology not supported by Microsoft Edge**
- ActiveX controls
- x-ua-compatible headers
- &lt;meta&gt; tags
- Legacy document modes



>[!TIP]
>You can also use Enterprise Mode with Microsoft Edge to transition only the sites that need these technologies to load in IE11. For info about Enterprise Mode and Edge, see [Use Enterprise Mode to improve compatibility](../emie-to-improve-compatibility.md). 


If you have specific websites and apps that you know have compatibility problems with Microsoft Edge, you can use the Enterprise Mode site list so that the websites automatically open using Internet Explorer 11. Additionally, if you know that your intranet sites aren't going to work correctly with Microsoft Edge, you can set all intranet sites to open using IE11 automatically.

Using Enterprise Mode means that you can continue to use Microsoft Edge as your default browser, while also ensuring that your apps continue working on IE11.
