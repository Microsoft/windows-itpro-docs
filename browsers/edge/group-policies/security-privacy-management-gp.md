# Security and privacy management
>*Supported versions: Microsoft Edge on Windows 10*

Microsoft Edge is designed with improved security in mind, helping to defend people from increasingly sophisticated and prevalent web-based attacks against Windows. Because Microsoft Edge is designed like a Universal Windows app, changing the browser to an app, it fundamentally changes the process model so that both the outer manager process and the different content processes all live within app container sandboxes. 

Microsoft Edge runs in 64-bit not just by default, but anytime it’s running on a 64-bit operating system. Because Microsoft Edge doesn’t support legacy ActiveX controls or 3rd-party binary extensions, there’s no longer a reason to run 32-bit processes on a 64-bit system. 

The value of running 64-bit all the time is that it strengthens Windows Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), randomizing the memory layout of the browser processes, making it much harder for attackers to hit precise memory locations. In turn, 64-bit processes make ASLR much more effective by making the address space exponentially larger and, therefore, more difficult for attackers to find sensitive memory components.

|---|---|
| **[Windows Hello](http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/03/17/making-windows-10-more-personal-and-more-secure-with-windows-hello/)** | Authenticates the user and the website with asymmetric cryptography technology. Microsoft Edge natively supports Windows Hello as a more personal, seamless, and secure way to authenticate on the web, powered by an early implementation of the [Web Authentication (formerly FIDO 2.0 Web API) specification](http://w3c.github.io/webauthn/). |
| **Microsoft SmartScreen** | Defends against phishing by performing reputation checks on sites visited and blocking any site that is thought to be a phishing site. SmartScreen also helps to defend against installing malicious software or file downloads, even from trusted sites. |
| **Certificate Reputation system** | Collects data about certificates in use, detecting new certificates and flagging fraudulent certificates automatically. |
| **Microsoft EdgeHTML** | Defends against hacking through the following security standards features:<ul><li>Support for the W3C standard for Content Security Policy (CSP), which helps web developers defend their sites against cross-site scripting attacks.</li><li>Support for the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) feature, which is IETF-standard compliant, and helps to ensure that connections to sites are always secure.</li></ul> |
| **Code integrity and image loading restrictions** | Prevents malicious DLLs from loading or injecting into the content processes. Only signed images are allowed to load in Microsoft Edge. Binaries on remote devices (such as UNC or WebDAV) can&#39;t load. |
| **Memory corruption mitigations** | Defends against memory corruption weaknesses and vulnerabilities with the use of [CWE-416: Use After Free](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html) (UAF). |
| **Memory Garbage Collector (MemGC) mitigation** | Replaces Memory Protector and helps to defend the browser from UAF vulnerabilities by freeing memory from the programmer and automating it, only freeing memory when the automation detects that there are no more references left pointing to a given block of memory. |
| **Control Flow Guard** | Compiles checks around code that performs indirect jumps based on a pointer, restricting those jumps to only going to function entry points with known addresses. Control Flow Guard is a Microsoft Visual Studio technology. |
