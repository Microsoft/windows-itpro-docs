# Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2 evaluation guide

When you set up HoloLens 2 devices for the Windows Autopilot program, your users can follow a simple process to provision the devices from the cloud.

This Autopilot program supports Autopilot self-deploying mode to provision HoloLens 2 devices as shared devices under your tenant. Self-deploying mode leverages the device's preinstalled OEM image and drivers during the provisioning process. A user can provision the device without putting the device on and going through the Out-of-the-box Experience (OOBE).  

![The Autopilot self-deploying process configures shared devices in "headless" mode by using a network connection.](./images/hololens-ap-intro.png)

When a user starts the Autopilot self-deploying process, the process completes the following steps:

1. Join the device to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
   > [!NOTE]  
   > Autopilot for HoloLens does not support Active Directory join or Hybrid Azure AD join.
1. Use Azure AD to enroll the device in Microsoft Intune (or another MDM service).
1. Download the device-targeted policies, user-targeted apps, certificates, and networking profiles.
1. Provision the device.
1. Present the sign-in screen to the user.

## Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2: Get started

The following steps summarize the process of setting up your environment for the Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2. The rest of this section provides the details of these steps.

1. Make sure that you meet the requirements for Windows Autopilot for HoloLens.
1. Enroll in the Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2 program.
1. Verify that your tenant is flighted (enrolled to participate in the program).
1. Register devices in Windows Autopilot.
1. Create a device group.
1. Create a deployment profile.
1. Verify the ESP configuration.
1. Configure a custom configuration profile for HoloLens devices (known issue).
1. Verify the profile status of the HoloLens devices.

### 1. Make sure that you meet the requirements for Windows Autopilot for HoloLens
For the latest information about how to participate in the program, review [Windows Insider Release Notes](hololens-insider.md#windows-insider-release-notes).

Review the following sections of the Windows Autopilot requirements article:

- [Network requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/windows-autopilot-requirements#networking-requirements)  
- [Licensing requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/windows-autopilot-requirements#licensing-requirements)  
- [Configuration requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/windows-autopilot-requirements#configuration-requirements)
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Unlike other Windows Autopilot programs, Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2 has specific operating system requirements.

Review the "[Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/self-deploying#requirements)" section of the Windows Autopilot Self-Deploying mode article. Your environment has to meet these requirements as well as the standard Windows Autopilot requirements.

> [!NOTE]  
> You do not have to review the "Step by step" and "Validation" sections of the article. The procedures later in this article provide corresponding steps that are specific to HoloLens.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For information about how to register devices and configure profiles, see [4. Register devices in Windows Autopilot](#4-register-devices-in-windows-autopilot) and [6. Create a deployment profile](#6-create-a-deployment-profile) in this article. These sections provide steps that are specific to HoloLens.

Before you start the OOBE and provisioning process, make sure that the HoloLens devices meet the following requirements:

- The devices are not already members of Azure AD, and are not enrolled in Intune (or another MDM system). The Autopilot self-deploying process completes these steps. To make sure that all the device-related information is cleaned up, check the **Devices** pages in both Azure AD and Intune.
- Every device can connect to the internet. You can use a wired or wireless connection.
- Every device can connect to a computer by using a USB-C cable, and that computer has the following available:
  - Advanced Recovery Companion (ARC)
  - The latest Windows update: Windows 10, version 19041.1002.200107-0909 or a later version)

To configure and manage the Autopilot self-deploying mode profiles, make sure that you have access to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com).

### 2. Enroll in the Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2 program

To participate in the program, you have to use a tenant that is flighted for HoloLens. To do this, go to  [Windows Autopilot for HoloLens Private Preview request](https://aka.ms/APHoloLensTAP) or use the following QR code to submit a request.  

![Autopilot QR code](./images/hololens-ap-qrcode.png)  

In this request, provide the following information:

- Tenant domain
- Tenant ID
- Number of HoloLens 2 devices that are participating in this evaluation
- Number of HoloLens 2 devices that you plan to deploy by using Autopilot self-deploying mode

### 3. Verify that your tenant is flighted

To verify that your tenant is flighted for the Autopilot program after you submit your request, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com).
1. Select **Devices** > **Windows** > **Windows enrollment** > **Windows Autopilot deployment profiles** > **Create profile**.  
   
   ![Create profile dropdown includes a HoloLens item.](./images/hololens-ap-enrollment-profiles.png)
  You should see a list that includes **HoloLens**. If this option is not present, use one of the [Feedback](#feedback) options to contact us.

### 4. Register devices in Windows Autopilot

To register a HoloLens device in the Windows Autopilot program, you have to obtain the hardware hash of the device (also known as the hardware ID). The device can record its hardware hash in a CSV file during the OOBE process, or later when a device owner starts the diagnostic log collection process (described in the following procedure). Typically, the device owner is the first user to sign in to the device.

**Retrieve a device hardware hash**

1. Start the HoloLens 2 device.
1. On the device, press the Power and Volume Down buttons at the same time and then release them. The device collects diagnostic logs and the hardware hash, and stores them in a set of .zip files.
1. Use a USB-C cable to connect the device to a computer.
1. On the computer, open File Explorer. Open **This PC\\\<*HoloLens device name*>\\Internal Storage\\Documents**, and locate the AutopilotDiagnostics.zip file.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The .zip file may not immediately be available. If the file is not ready yet you may see a HoloLensDiagnostics.temp file in the Documents folder. To update the list of files, refresh the window.

1. Extract the contents of the AutopilotDiagnostics.zip file.
1. In the extracted files, locate the CSV file that has a file name prefix of "DeviceHash." Copy that file to a drive on the computer where you can access it later.  
   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > The data in the CSV file should use the following header and line format:
   > ```
   > Device Serial Number,Windows Product ID,Hardware Hash,Group Tag,Assigned User <serialNumber>,<ProductID>,<hardwareHash>,<optionalGroupTag>,<optionalAssignedUser>
   >```

**Register the device in Windows Autopilot**

1. In Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center, select **Devices** > **Windows** > **Windows enrollment**, and then select **Devices** > **Import** under **Windows Autopilot Deployment Program**.

1. Under **Add Windows Autopilot devices**, select the DeviceHash CSV file, select **Open**, and then select **Import**.  
   
   ![Use the Import command to import the hardware hash.](./images/hololens-ap-hash-import.png)
1. After the import finishes, select **Devices** > **Windows** > **Windows enrollment** > **Devices** > **Sync**. The process might take a few minutes to complete, depending on how many devices are being synchronized. To see the registered device, select **Refresh**.  
   
   ![Use the Sync and Refresh commands to view the device list.](./images/hololens-ap-devices-sync.png)  

### 5. Create a device group

1. In Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, select **Groups** > **New group**.
1. For **Group type**, select **Security**, and then enter a group name and description.
1. For **Membership type**, select either **Assigned** or **Dynamic Device**.
1. Do one of the following:  
   
   - If you selected **Assigned** for **Membership type** in the previous step, select **Members**, and then add Autopilot devices to the group. Autopilot devices that aren't yet enrolled are listed by using the device serial number as the device name.
   - If you selected **Dynamic Devices** for **Membership type** in the previous step, select **Dynamic device members**, and then enter code in **Advanced rule** that resembles the following:
     - If you want to create a group that includes all of your Autopilot devices, type: `(device.devicePhysicalIDs -any _ -contains "[ZTDId]")`
     - Intune's group tag field maps to the **OrderID** attribute on Azure AD devices. If you want to create a group that includes all of your Autopilot devices that have a specific group tag (the Azure AD device OrderID), you must type: `(device.devicePhysicalIds -any _ -eq "[OrderID]:179887111881")`
     - If you want to create a group that includes all your Autopilot devices that have a specific Purchase Order ID, type: `(device.devicePhysicalIds -any _ -eq "[PurchaseOrderId]:76222342342")`

     > [!NOTE]  
     > These rules target attributes that are unique to Autopilot devices.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Create**.

### 6. Create a deployment profile

1. In Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, select **Devices** > **Windows** > **Windows enrollment** > **Windows Autopilot deployment profiles** > **Create profile** > **HoloLens**.
1. Enter a profile name and description, and then select **Next**.  
   
   ![Add a profile name and description](./images/hololens-ap-profile-name.png)
1. On the **Out-of-box experience (OOBE)** page, most of the settings are pre-configured to streamline OOBE for this evaluation. Optionally, you can configure the following settings:  

   - **Language (Region)**: Select the language for OOBE. We recommend that you select a language from the list of [supported languages for HoloLens 2](hololens2-language-support.md).
   - **Automatically configure keyboard**: To make sure that the keyboard matches the selected language, select **Yes**.
   - **Apply device name template**: To automatically set the device name during OOBE, select **Yes** and then enter the template phrase and placeholders in **Enter a name** For example, enter a prefix and `%RAND:4%`&mdash;a placeholder for a four-digit random number.
     > [!NOTE]  
     > If you use a device name template, the OOBE process restarts the device one additional time after it applies the device name and before it joins the device to Azure AD. This restart enables the new name to take effect.  

   ![Configure OOBE settings](./images/hololens-ap-profile-oobe.png)
1. After you configure the settings, select **Next**.
1. On the **Scope tags** page, optionally add the scope tags that you want to apply to this profile. For more information about scope tags, see [Use role-based access control and scope tags for distributed IT](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/fundamentals/scope-tags.md). When finished, select **Next**.
1. On the **Assignments** page, select **Selected groups** for **Assign to**.
1. Under **SELECTED GROUPS**, select **+ Select groups to include**.

## Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2 User Experience

Your HoloLens users can follow these steps to provision HoloLens devices.  

1. Use the USB-C cable to connect the HoloLens device to a computer that has Advanced Recovery Companion (ARC) installed and has the appropriate Windows update downloaded.
1. Use ARC to flash the appropriate version of Windows on to the device.
1. Connect the device to the network, and then restart the device.  
   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > You must connect the device to the network before the Out-of-the-Box-Experience (OOBE) starts. The device determines whether it is provisioning as an Autopilot device while on the first OOBE screen. If the device cannot connect to the network, or if you choose not to provision the device as an Autopilot device, you cannot change to Autopilot provisioning at a later time. Instead, you would have to start this procedure over in order to provision the device as an Autopilot device.

   The device should automatically start OOBE. Do not interact with OOBE. Instead sit, back and relax! Let HoloLens 2 detect network connectivity and allow it complete OOBE automatically. The device may restart during OOBE. The OOBE screens should resemble the following.
   
   ![OOBE step 1](./images/hololens-ap-uex-1.png)
   ![OOBE step 2](./images/hololens-ap-uex-2.png)
   ![OOBE step 3](./images/hololens-ap-uex-3.png)
   ![OOBE step 4](./images/hololens-ap-uex-4.png)

At the end of OOBE, you can sign in to the device by using your user name and password.
