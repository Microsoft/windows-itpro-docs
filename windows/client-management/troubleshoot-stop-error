# Advanced Troubleshooting Stop error or blue screen issue

>[!HOME USERS]
>This article is intended for use by support agents and IT professionals. If you're looking for more information about Stop error ("blue screen") messages, see the following resource: [Troubleshoot blue screen errors](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238)

 
### What causes Stop errors?

There is no simple explanation for the cause of Stop errors (also known as blue screen errors or bug check errors). Many different factors can be involved. However, various studies indicate that Stop errors usually are not caused by Microsoft Windows components. Instead, these errors are generally related to malfunctioning hardware drivers or drivers that are installed by third-party software. This includes video cards, wireless network cards, security programs, and so on.

Our analysis of the root causes of crashes indicates the following:

- 70 percent are caused by third-party driver code
- 10 percent are caused by hardware issues 
- 5 percent are caused by Microsoft code
- 15 percent have unknown causes (because the memory is too corrupted to analyze)

### General troubleshooting steps

To troubleshoot Stop error messages, follow these general steps:

1. Review the Stop Error code that you find in the event logs. Search for the specific Stop error codes to see whether there are any known issues, resolutions, or workarounds for the problem.
2. As a best practice, we recommend that you do the following:
    a. Make sure that you install the latest Windows updates, cumulative updates, and rollup updates. To verify the update status, refer to the appropriate update history webpage for your system:
        - [Windows 10, version 1803](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4099479)
        - [Windows 10, version 1709](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4043454)
        - [Windows 10, version 1703](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4018124)
        - [Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10, version 1607](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4000825)
        - [Windows 10, version 1511](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4000824)
        - [Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4009470)
        - [Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 SP1](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4009469)

    b. Make sure that the BIOS and firmware are up-to-date.
    c. Run any relevant hardware and memory tests.

3. Run the [Machine Memory Dump Collector](https://home.diagnostics.support.microsoft.com/selfhelp?knowledgebasearticlefilter=2027760&wa=wsignin1.0) Windows diagnostic package. This diagnostic tool is used to collect machine memory dump files and check for known solutions.
4. Run [Microsoft Safety Scanner](http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx) or any other virus detection program that includes checks of the Master Boot Record for infections.
5. Make sure that there is sufficient free space on the hard disk. The exact requirement varies, but we recommend 10 to 15 percent free disk space.
6. Contact the respective hardware or software vendor to update the drivers and applications in the following scenarios:
  
    - The error message indicates that a specific driver is causing the problem.
    - You are seeing an indication of a service that is starting or stopping before the crash occurred. In this situation, determine whether the service behavior is consistent across all instances of the crash.
    - You have made any software or hardware changes.
        >**Note** If there are no updates available from a specific manufacturer, it is recommended that you disable the related service.
        
        >To do this, see [How to perform a clean boot in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/929135)
        
        >You can disable a driver by following the steps in [How to temporarily deactivate the kernel mode filter driver in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/816071).

You may also want to consider the option of rolling back changes or reverting to the last-known working state. For more information, see the following topic: [Roll Back a Device Driver to a Previous Version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc732648(v=ws.11)).

### Memory dump collection

To configure the system for memory dump files, follow these steps:

1. Download and install [DumpConfigurator](http://winplattools.codeplex.com/releases/view/119856).
2. Start the tool, and then select Elevate this HTA.
3. Select Auto Config Kernel.
4. Restart the computer for the setting to take effect. 
5. Stop and disable Automatic System Restart Services (ASR) to prevent dump files from being written. 
6. If the server is virtualized, disable autoreboot after the memory dump file is created. This lets you take a snapshot of the server in-state and also if the problem recurs.

The memory dump file is saved at the following locations.

| Dump file type | Location |
|----------------|----------|
|(none) | %SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP (inactive, or greyed out) |
|Small memory dump file (256kb) | %SystemRoot%\Minidump |
|Kernel memory dump file | %SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP |
| Complete memory dump file | %SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP |
| Automatic memory dump file | %SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP |
| Active memory dump file | %SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP |

You can use the Microsoft DumpChk (Crash Dump File Checker) tool to verify that the memory dump files are not corrupted or invalid. For more information, see the following video:

- [How to generate a kernel or a complete memory dump file in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2](https://support.microsoft.com/help/969028)

### Memory dump analysis

Finding the root cause of the crash many not be easy. Hardware problems are especially difficult to diagnose because they may cause erratic and unpredictable behavior that can manifest itself in a variety of symptoms.

When a Stop error occurs, you should first isolate the problematic components, and then try to cause them to trigger the Stop error again. If you can replicate the problem, you can usually determine the cause.

You can use the tools such as Windows Software Development KIT (SDK) and Symbols to diagnose dump logs.

### Advanced troubleshooting

**Using Driver Verifier**

We estimate that about 75 percent of all Stop errors are caused by faulty drivers. The Driver Verifier tool provides several methods to help you troubleshoot. These include running drivers in an isolated memory pool (without sharing memory with other components), generating extreme memory pressure, and validating parameters. If the tool encounters errors in the execution of driver code, it proactively creates an exception to let that part of the code be examined further.

>Warning
>Driver Verifier consumes lots of CPU and can slow down the computer significantly. You may also experience additional crashes. Verifier disables faulty drivers after a Stop error occurs, and continues to do this until you can successfully restart the system and access the desktop. You can also expect to see several dump files created.

**Caution** Don’t try to verify all the drivers at one time. This can degrade performance and make the system unusable. This also limits the effectiveness of the tool.

Use the following guidelines when you use Driver Verifier:  

- Test any “suspicious” drivers (drivers that were recently updated or that are known to be problematic).
- If you continue to experience non-analyzable crashes, try enabling verification on all third-party and unsigned drivers.
- Enable concurrent verification on groups of 10 to 20 drivers.
- Additionally, if the computer cannot boot into the desktop because of Driver Verifier, you can disable the tool by starting in Safe mode. This is because the tool cannot run in Safe mode.

For more information, see [Driver Verifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/driver-verifier).


### Common Windows Stop errors

>Important: This section doesn't contain a list of all error codes, but since many error codes have the same potential resolutions, your best bet is to follow the steps below to troubleshoot your error.

>A Stop error is displayed as a blue screen that contains the name of the faulty driver, such as any of the following example drivers:
>- atikmpag.sys
>- igdkmd64.sys
