# Test scenario 1 – Sign into Azure AD, enable the wake word, and try a voice query

>[!NOTE]
>The wake word has been temporarily disabled in the latest version of Cortana in Windows but will be restored soon.

1. Select the **Cortana** icon in the task bar and sign in using your Azure AD account.

2. Select the &quot;…&quot; menu and select **Talking to Cortana**.

3. Toggle **Wake word** to **On** and close Cortana.

4. Say **Cortana, what can you do?**.

When you say **Cortana**, Cortana will open in listening mode to acknowledge the wake word.

Once you finish saying your query, Cortana will open with the result.

>[!NOTE]
>If you've disabled the wake word using MDM or Group Policy, you will need to manually activate the microphone by selecting Cortana, then the mic button.
