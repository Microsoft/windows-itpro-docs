# Monitor Windows Updates with Update Compliance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While [Windows Analytics was retired on January 31, 2020](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/update-compliance-monitor), support for Update Compliance has continued through the Azure Portal; however, please note the following updates:
>
> * On March 31, 2020, the Windows Defender Antivirus reporting feature of Update Compliance will be removed. You can continue to define and review security compliance policies using [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/configmgr/), which allows finer control over security features and updates.
> * The Perspectives feature of Update Compliance will also be removed on March 31, 2020 in favor of a better experience. The Perspectives feature is part of the Log Search portal of Log Analytics, which was deprecated on February 15, 2019 in favor of [Azure Monitor Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/log-search-transition). Your Update Compliance solution will be automatically upgraded to Azure Monitor Logs, and the data available in Perspectives will be migrated to a set of queries in the [Needs Attention section](update-compliance-need-attention.md) of Update Compliance.


## Introduction

Update Compliance enables organizations to:

* Monitor security, quality, and feature updates for Windows 10 Professional, Education, and Enterprise editions.
* View a report of device and update issues related to compliance that need attention.
* Check bandwidth savings incurred across multiple content types by using [Delivery Optimization](waas-delivery-optimization.md).

Update Compliance is offered through the Azure portal, and is included as part of Windows 10 licenses listed in the [prerequisites](update-compliance-get-started.md#update-compliance-prerequisites).

Update Compliance uses Windows 10 and Windows Defender Antivirus diagnostic data for all of its reporting. It collects system data including update deployment progress, [Windows Update for Business](waas-manage-updates-wufb.md) configuration data, Windows Defender Antivirus data, and Delivery Optimization usage data, and then sends this data to a secure cloud to be stored for analysis and usage in [Azure Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/query-language/get-started-analytics-portal).

See the following topics in this guide for detailed information about configuring and using the Update Compliance solution:

- [Get started with Update Compliance](update-compliance-get-started.md): How to add Update Compliance to your environment.
- [Using Update Compliance](update-compliance-using.md): How to begin using Update Compliance.

## Update Compliance architecture

The Update Compliance architecture and data flow follows this process:

1. User computers send diagnostic data to a secure Microsoft data center using the Microsoft Data Management Service.
2. Diagnostic data is analyzed by the Update Compliance Data Service.
3. Diagnostic data is pushed from the Update Compliance Data Service to your Azure Monitor workspace.
4. Diagnostic data is available in the Update Compliance solution.


> [!NOTE]
> This process assumes that Windows diagnostic data is enabled and data sharing is enabled as outlined in the enrollment section of [Get started with Update Compliance](update-compliance-get-started.md).
