# Windows 10, version 2004 required Windows diagnostic events and fields


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Windows is moving to classifying the data collected from customerâ€™s devices as either *Required* or *Optional*.


 **Applies to**

- Windows 10, version 2004


Required diagnostic data gathers a limited set of information that is critical for understanding the device and its configuration including: basic device information, quality-related information, app compatibility, and Microsoft Store.

Required diagnostic data helps to identify problems that can occur on a particular device hardware or software configuration. For example, it can help determine if crashes are more frequent on devices with a specific amount of memory or that are running a particular driver version. This helps Microsoft fix operating system or app problems.

Use this article to learn about diagnostic events, grouped by event area, and the fields within each event. A brief description is provided for each field. Every event generated includes common data, which collects device data.

### Aria.f4a7d46e472049dfba756e11bdbbc08f.Microsoft.WebBrowser.SystemInfo.Config

This config event sends basic device connectivity and configuration information from Microsoft Edge about the current data collection consent, app version, and installation state to keep Microsoft Edge up to date and secure.

The following fields are available:

- **app_sample_rate**  A number representing how often the client sends telemetry, expressed as a percentage. Low values indicate that said client sends more events and high values indicate that said client sends fewer events.
- **app_version**  The internal Edge build version string, taken from the UMA metrics field system_profile.app_version.
- **appConsentState**  Bit flags describing consent for data collection on the machine or zero if the state was not retrieved. The following are true when the associated bit is set: consent was granted (0x1), consent was communicated at install (0x2), diagnostic data consent granted (0x20000), browsing data consent granted (0x40000).
- **Channel**  An integer indicating the channel of the installation (Canary or Dev).
- **client_id**  A unique identifier with which all other diagnostic client data is associated, taken from the UMA metrics provider. This ID is effectively unique per device, per OS user profile, per release channel (e.g. Canary/Dev/Beta/Stable). client_id is not durable, based on user preferences. client_id is initialized on the first application launch under each OS user profile. client_id is linkable, but not unique across devices or OS user profiles. client_id is reset whenever UMA data collection is disabled, or when the application is uninstalled.
- **ConnectionType**  The first reported type of network connection currently connected. This can be one of Unknown, Ethernet, WiFi, 2G, 3G, 4G, None, or Bluetooth.
- **container_client_id**  The client ID of the container, if in WDAG mode. This will be different from the UMA log client ID, which is the client ID of the host in WDAG mode.
- **container_session_id**  The session ID of the container, if in WDAG mode. This will be different from the UMA log session ID, which is the session ID of the host in WDAG mode.
- **Etag**  Etag is an identifier representing all service applied configurations and experiments for the current browser session. This field is left empty when Windows diagnostic level is set to Basic or lower or when consent for diagnostic data has been denied.
- **EventInfo.Level**  The minimum Windows diagnostic data level required for the event where 1 is basic, 2 is enhanced, and 3 is full.
- **install_date**  The date and time of the most recent installation in seconds since midnight on January 1, 1970 UTC, rounded down to the nearest hour.
- **installSource**  An enumeration representing the source of this installation: source was not retrieved (0), unspecified source (1), website installer (2), enterprise MSI (3), Windows update (4), Edge updater (5), scheduled or timed task (6, 7), uninstall (8), Edge about page (9), self-repair (10), other install command line (11), reserved (12), unknown source (13).
- **PayloadClass**  The base class used to serialize and deserialize the Protobuf binary payload.
- **PayloadGUID**  A random identifier generated for each original monolithic Protobuf payload, before the payload is potentially broken up into manageably-sized chunks for transmission.
- **PayloadLogType**  The log type for the event correlating with 0 for unknown, 1 for stability, 2 for on-going, 3 for independent, 4 for UKM, or 5 for instance level.
- **pop_sample**  A value indicating how the device's data is being sampled.
- **reconsentConfigs**  A comma separated list of all reconsent configurations the current installation has received. Each configuration follows a well-defined format: 2DigitMonth-2DigitYear-3LetterKeyword.
- **session_id**  An identifier that is incremented each time the user launches the application, irrespective of any client_id changes. session_id is seeded during the initial installation of the application. session_id is effectively unique per client_id value. Several other internal identifier values, such as window or tab IDs, are only meaningful within a particular session. The session_id value is forgotten when the application is uninstalled, but not during an upgrade.
- **utc_flags**  Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) flags required for the event as part of the data collection process.
