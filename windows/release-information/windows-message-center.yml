This vulnerability affects Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and earlier versions of Windows nearing end of support. It does not affect Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, or newer operating systems. While we have not observed attacks exploiting this vulnerability, affected systems should be patched with priority. Here is what you need to know:<br> <br>
<strong>Call to action:</strong>
<ul>
<li>	If you are running a supported version of Windows and have automatic updates enabled, you are automatically protected and do not need to take any action. </li>
<li>	If you are managing updates on behalf of your organization, you should download the latest updates from the <a href='https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/' target='_blank'>Microsoft Security Update Guide</a> and apply them to your Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2008 devices as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
Given the potential impact to customers and their businesses, we have also released <a href='https://support.microsoft.com/help/4500705' target='_blank'>security updates for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003</a>, even though these operating systems have reached end of support (except by custom support agreements). While we recommend that you upgrade to the current version of Windows to benefit from the latest security protections, these updates are available from the Microsoft Update Catalog only.

<li>	May 3, 2019 was the \\\"optional\\\" Windows 10, version 1809 \\\"C\\\" release for April. This update contained important <a href='https://support.microsoft.com/help/4470918/updates-for-may-2019-japan-era-change' target='_blank'>Japanese era</a> packages for commercial customers to preview.
