# Memory integrity

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

Memory integrity is a feature of Windows that ensures that code that can run in Windows' kernel is securely designed and trustworthy.  It is  powerful security boundary that leverages hardware virtualization and Hyper-V to protect Windows kernel mode processes against injection and execution of malicious or unverified code.  The integrity of code that runs on Windows is validated by Memory integrity so that Windows is resistant to attack from malicious software. Memory integrity helps block many types of malware from running in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 environments.
