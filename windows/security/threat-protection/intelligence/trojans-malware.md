# Trojans

Trojans are a common type of malware which, unlike viruses, can’t spread on their own. This means they either have to be downloaded manually or another malware needs to download and install them.

Trojans often use the same file names as real and legitimate apps. It is easy to accidentally download a trojan thinking that it is a legitimate app.

## Different types of trojans

01. Backdoor: 
A backdoor Trojan gives malicious users remote control over the infected computer. They enable the author to do anything they wish on the infected computer – including sending, receiving, launching and deleting files, displaying data and rebooting the computer. Backdoor Trojans are often used to unite a group of victim computers to form a botnet or zombie network that can be used for criminal purposes.

02. Exploit:
Exploits are programs that contain data or code that takes advantage of a vulnerability within application software that’s running on your computer.

03. Rootkit:
Rootkits are designed to conceal certain objects or activities in your system. Often their main purpose is to prevent malicious programs being detected – in order to extend the period in which programs can run on an infected computer.

04.Trojan-Banker :: 
Trojan-Banker programs are designed to steal your account data for online banking systems, e-payment systems and credit or debit cards.

05. Trojan-DoS:
These programs conduct DoS (Denial of Service) attacks against a targeted web address. By sending multiple requests – from your computer and several other infected computers – the attack can overwhelm the target address, leading to a denial of service.

06. Trojan-Downloader ::  
Trojan-Downloaders can download and install new versions of malicious programs onto your computer – including Trojans and adware.

07. Trojan-Dropper:
These programs are used by hackers in order to install Trojans and / or viruses – or to prevent the detection of malicious programs. Not all antivirus programs are capable of scanning all of the components inside this type of Trojan.

08.Trojan-FakeAV ::  
Trojan-FakeAV programs simulate the activity of antivirus software. They are designed to extort money from you – in return for the detection and removal of threats, even though the threats that they report are actually non-existent.

09. Trojan-GameThief:
This type of program steals user account information from online gamers.

10. Trojan-IM:
Trojan-IM programs steal your logins and passwords for instant messaging programs – such as ICQ, MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Pager, Skype, and many more.

11.Trojan-Ransom ::
This type of Trojan can modify data on your computer so that your computer doesn’t run correctly or you can no longer use specific data. The criminal will only restore your computer’s performance or unblock your data after you have paid them the ransom money that they demand.

12.Trojan-SMS ::
These programs can cost you money – by sending text messages from your mobile device to premium rate phone numbers.

13. Trojan-Spy:
Trojan-Spy programs can spy on how you’re using your computer – for example, by tracking the data you enter via your keyboard, taking screen shots or getting a list of running applications.

14. Trojan-Mailfinder: 
These programs can harvest email addresses from your computer.

### Trojans are mostly come from different sources
01. Downloadable Programs:
One of the possible sources of virus attacks is downloadable programs from the web. 
Unreliable sources and internet newsgroups are one of the main sources of computer virus attacks.

02. Cracked Software:
Cracked software proves to be yet another source of virus attacks. Most people who download cracked and illegal versions of software online are unaware of their reality and that they may contain virus sources as well.

03.Booting from Unknown CD ::
One of the other sources of virus attacks is through an unknown CD. Most computer users believe that one of the most common ways of virus infection is through a Data CD. It is a good practice to remove the CD when the computer system is not used.
